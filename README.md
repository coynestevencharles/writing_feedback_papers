# writing_feedback_papers

This repository contains a list of papers about written corrective feedback in educational settings.

The focus is mostly on feedback for written language errors made by English learners and on applying feedback principles to educational technologies. This includes generating effective feedback in writing assistance and chat systems. Thus, some papers touch on grammatical error detection, classification, and correction or neural text generation.

**General Inclusion and Formatting Rules:**

* Entries in a list are sorted by last name of the first author, then by publication date.
* Prefer the published version of a work to a preprint.
* Link to a paper profile page rather than a PDF whenever possible.
* Links are DOIs whenever possible.
